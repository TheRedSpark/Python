I am a student from Dresden and would like to have my 
Document learning progress in using Python. You’re welcome to browse a bit. Maybe I was able to help you with one of your own projects.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to open a new problem. I’ll do my best to help you.

LG and have fun

Getting started
---------------

- For all my projects I use: PyCharm Community Edition
- Download link:https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/download
- In my experience one of the best IDE for Python

Projects
---------------
- A selection of my projects you will find above in the individual folders.
- A good indicator for a finished/working project is a lot of comments or if in the 
first line a # “live” is written
```shell

# Stand 15.05.2022 live
import mysql.connector  # V8.0.28
import sys
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # V4.10.0
import requests # V2.27.1

def main_funktion():
    if statment = True:
    .
    .
    .
```
